 A government by definition is a group of individuals working together to run a state or a country, where the only measure of progress and success is growth. Be it with the GDP, Budgeting split and financing, Infrastrucutre development, government policies,  the positively changing numbers and the upward trend is all that the people want to see. 

 Schools have thought us that a government comprises of the Judiciary, Executive, and the Legislature. Moving further, I would be focusing on the Union Executive Branch which is otherwise known as the central government. It consists of the Elected leaders whos decisions are responsible for taking the country forward because of which they are amongst the most talked about individuals in the country.

Setting aside our emotional mind, everyone deserves and needs to understand what it takes to “run” a country and keeping it growing. It is a **combined effort** from the Council of Ministers lead by the Prime Minister to achive common goals.

To put the country in its best possible position, it requires for a collaborative approach from the  council of ministers who are responsible for specific portfolios or departments to work together by supporting and complementing each other, and the Prime Minister's role here is to coordinate the activities of the various ministries, ensure effective decision making, and to promote cohesion and unity among the ministers.

Each minister brings their expertise and perspective to the table, contributing to discussions, proposing initiatives, and are responsible for overseeing the implementation of policies within their respective portfolios.

### **The Graduates Example:**

I have come up with this exmaple to support my idealogy mentioned above, 

The Ministry of Education has done its job with various policies and measures, and the country now has a number of graduates that are looking for employment in the Maritime Industry and so the government and the Ministry of Labour and Employment has to create opportunities. 

The Prime Minister holds a meeting, and the ministers that are responsible for the task at hand would include: 

1. Ministry of Ports,Shipping and Waterways 
    
    This ministry would play a crucial role in developing and expanding the maritime infrastructure, including ports, shipping channels, and logistics facilities to create employment for which they require investment or allocation of fund from the Minitry of Finance. 
    
2. Ministry of External Affairs 
    
    The Ministry of External Affairs would be involved in establishing international collaborations and partnerships with other countries  in the maritime sector. They would focus on negotiating favorable trade agreements, promoting the country's maritime interests globally, and play key role attracting and adivicing the Minitry of Finance about foreign investement.
    
3. Ministry of Finance 
    
    The Ministry of Finance would be responsible for providing financial support and incentives to stimulate growth in the maritime industry. By creating favorable tax policies, offering subsidies and developing financing mechanisms to support infrastructure development and investment in the sector.
    
4. Ministry of Roads and Highways 
    
    This ministry would be responsible for improving road and highway connectivity to ports and maritime clusters to facilitate the movement of goods and people, ensuring efficient logistics operations.
    
5. Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
    
    The Ministry of Corporate Affairs would be involved in creating a conducive business environment for the maritime industry. Establishing regulatory processes, promoting ease of doing business, and directing foreign companies and investment.
    
6. Ministry of Railways 
    
    The Ministry of Railways would play a significant role in developing railway infrastructure by enhancing rail freight services, and facilitating the seamless movement of cargo between ports and inland locations.
    

Together, these ministries would collaborate to formulate policies, implement measures, and allocate resources to create employment opportunities in the Maritime Industry. By leveraging their respective expertise and coordinating their efforts, they would foster the growth in the maritime sector and address the needs of the graduates seeking employment.

I hope this example helps you understand the level of coordination that is required and the number of people that have to come together to make it happen. It is quite different from what we usually hear on the TV.
