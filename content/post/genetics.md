We talk about genetic Engineering here- So, 

It is important to have good and reliable healthcare system, because nothing that can ultimately lead to loss of life be predicted- wars, geopolitical conflits, floods. 

In medicine, DNA sequencing is used for a range of purposes, including diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, Cystic fibrosis. DNA sequencing allows Doctors to determine if a gene or the region that regulates a gene contains changes called mutations, that have lead to certain changes which range from the working of the body to the looks of it in a person.

CRISPR is a family of DNA sequences found in organisms such as bacteria. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Cas9 is a protein which plays a vital role in immunological defence against DNA viruses and is used in the genetic engineering process.

And when you combine those two it becomes an editor, not for videos but for genes, not premier pro but CRISPR-Cas9, it precisely cuts parts of your DNA and then replaces it with the programmed DNA- made in a lab and which means you are now capable of changing a certain function in your body. 

Bioinformatics is for the tech savy biology geeks because it uses computers to maintain, track, analyse the biological data, it includes database computing, molecular biology, data analysis and many more.

The Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) was the first and largest international effort to characterize the functional side of the human genome. This massive resource has insights about gene regulation, evolution and diseases.
